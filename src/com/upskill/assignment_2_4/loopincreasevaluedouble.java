/*This program uses a for loop with a loop variable i that starts at 1 and 
 * increments by 1 each time the loop iterates. The loop continues until the value of x is greater than 500. 
 * Inside the loop, the value of x is doubled using the expression x = x * 2, and 
 * the current value of x is printed to the console along with the current iteration number.
 * 
 * Note that the loop stops after the 9th iteration, because the value of x 
 * becomes greater than 500 on the 10th iteration.*/
